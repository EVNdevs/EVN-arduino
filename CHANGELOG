0.10.5 (05/08/24)

Very small update, most of the changes are to the documentation

-- Features --

Library now raises readable errors when compiling without EVN Alpha selected, or with an Arduino-Pico core version that is too old

Docs now have images of the standard peripherals!

-- Bugfixes --

Not a bugfix, but EVNDrivebase seems to have some issues at low speeds using EV3 Medium motors

We will be looking into this issue and hopefully pushing changes to fix it if it is common.

0.10.4 (01/08/24)

This is a small update to update docs and make style changes to the library.

Many aliased (duplicate) functions have been removed from the following classes:
* EVNAlpha
* EVNMotor
* EVNDrivebase
* EVNIMUSensor
* EVNColourSensor
* EVNServo
* EVNContinuousServo

More alias functions may be removed in future updates, and some may remain but this will be an exception, not the norm moving forward.

-- Bugfixes --

EVNMotor: stop() was declared but undefined. It has now been defined, and replaces brake() as the braking function. So do not call brake() in your code.

-- Features --

- Madgwick IMU Sensor Fusion and Axis Configuration added to EVNIMUSensor and EVNCompassSensor

-- Bugfixes --

- Improved stability for EVNDrivebase
- EVNDrivebase and EVNMotor must be run on 2nd core, docs now reflect this

0.10.2 (07/07/24)

-- Features --

- User Guides have been added to the docs site! With more coming soon
- This small update is mainly to fix bugs with EVNMotor and EVNDrivebase
- There will be at least one more before this repository is displayed on the main EVNdevs GitHub repo.

-- Bugfixes --

- runPosition and similar position-based run functions now work properly when called back-to-back
- Accel/decel has correct logic now
- Motor jitter on boot is now gone

0.10.1 (28/06/24)

-- Features --

- Added docs and more unified syntax for almost all classes introduced in 0.10.0 (except EVNAnalogMux)
- Added more hardware/product docs
- Added example programs for almost everything (at this point I should relook at the old ones)
- Low Battery Alert has officially been added!

-- Bugfixes --

- EVNRGBLED: Stability of update() improved (should be perfect now)
- EVNButton: Stability of button readings should be much improved

0.10.0 (30/05/24)

"Why is every revision a major one?"

-- Features --

- Last few peripherals added: EVNSevenSegmentLED, EVNMatrixLED, EVNAnalogMux & EVNContinuousServo (most have no docs, to be added soon)
- More more bugfixes
- There will be more tutorials and better docs in the next 0.10.x revisions

-- Bugfixes --

- EVNRGBLED: Stability of update() improved
- EVNMotor & EVNDrivebase: Fixed long-running bug where timer interrupts were causing more complex programs to fail
- EVNDisplay rows are now zero-indexed (and this is permanent)
- EVNAlpha: fixed bug where cell voltage measurement would fail 40s after begin()

0.9.0 (13/05/24)

- Changelog now has new entries at top, not bottom
- Added the following libraries and docs: EVNRGBLED, EVNBluetooth, EVNServo, EVNEnvSensor, EVNTouchArray
- Added hardware documentation
- Made PID tuning for EVNDrivebase generally work on both Large and Medium motors
- Improved reliability and accuracy of EVNMotor DPS measurement
- More bugfixes and streamlining everywhere

-- Features --

- Docs have been reformatted for Read the Docs integration

- Complete rewrite of EVNMotor: position PD is used instead of speed PI control for greater stability
- Control units are all in DPS (degrees per second)
- Stall detection added

- First official addition of EVNDrivebase with motor sync & odometry

- All peripheral classes using I2C are now more strict about the use of begin()
- If begin() is not called or returns false, any other functions will automatically return 0

- Battery voltage monitoring functions added, with a battery alert whenever they are called
