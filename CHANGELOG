0.6.0 (16/1/24)
- First changelog entry!
- Added docs for EVNDistanceSensor and EVNCompassSensor

-- Features -- 
- EVNDistanceSensor added
- EVNMagSensor has been renamed to EVNCompassSensor
- Compatiibility with QMC5883L added to EVNCompassSensor
- EVNMotor now has functions to move to absolute position (not just relative position), and reset the encoder's absolute position to 0.

-- Bugfixes --
- Dependencies added (will be removed when published on Arduino's Library Manager)
- Fixed bug with EVNPortSelector, where port 1 should be selected at startup, but no "select port 1" I2C commands were actually sent.
- Rectified some math in EVNMotor such that any variables labelled PPR (pulse per revolution) actually reflect real-world motor encoder PPR
