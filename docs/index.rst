Welcome to EVN!
===================================

**EVN** is a Robotics System that we view as the natural evolution of LEGO® MINDSTORMS®.

It is built around the EVN Alpha - a Technic-compatible robot controller with 26 ports for I2C, UART, Servos, EV3 and NXT Motors, etc.

On this page, you will find user guides for EVN Alpha, hardware information and documentation for the EVN Arduino library, 
which uses the Arduino-Pico core by Earle Philhower for RP2040-based boards.
