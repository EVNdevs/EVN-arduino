API Style Guide
===============

API docs are unfortunately manually input and checked against the existing codebase, rather than being autogenerated.

This is due to the lengthy and somewhat questionable process of writing out docs in Doxygen (which does support C), and then
converting them to docs that Sphinx can understand using Breathe. It is not worth pursuing for this project at its current scale.

Perhaps one day it may be worth pursuing to avoid technical debt, but not now.

This page is an example API page! The starting paragraph can include important clarifying info, but 

.. note:: Put super important notes or warnings in their own pages like this

.. warning:: OR THIS
