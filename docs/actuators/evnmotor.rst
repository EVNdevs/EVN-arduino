``EVNMotor``
============

EVNMotor uses timer-generated interrupts to achieve consistent speed and position control. Using these functions, we have replicated most of the motor functions EV3 users will be familiar with.
We have built-in motor profiles for NXT Large Motors, EV3 Medium Motors and EV3 Large Motors, but the user may edit them if they wish to.

.. note:: EVNMotor consumers some of the RP2040's spinlock peripherals. See this `page`_ for more info.

.. _page: ../getting-started/hardware-overview.html

.. note:: For custom motors plugged into the 6-pin headers, users may have to set default parameters for the CUSTOM_MOTOR preset in `src/evn_motor_pids.h`, such as maximum RPM and encoder PPR (pulses per revolution).

.. warning:: A gearmotor and a LEGO motor should not be simultaneously plugged into the same motor port, as the 6-pin headers are wired in parallel with the LEGO ports.

.. note::
    EVNMotor uses the 2nd core to perform internal updates at a high rate. Between updates, user code can run on the 2nd core,
    but this configuration may cause timing-sensitive code to fail or lead to unexpected behaviour.

Constructor
-----------

.. class:: EVNMotor(uint8_t port, uint8_t motor_type = EV3_LARGE, uint8_t motor_dir = DIRECT, uint8_t enc_dir = DIRECT)
    
    :param port: Port the motor is connected to (1 - 4)
    
    :param motor_type: Type of motor connected. Defaults to ``EV3_LARGE``

        * ``EV3_LARGE`` - EV3 Large Servo Motor
        * ``EV3_MED`` - EV3 Medium Servo Motor
        * ``NXT_LARGE`` - NXT Large Servo Motor
        * ``CUSTOM_MOTOR`` - Custom Gearmotor
    
    :param motor_dir: When set to ``REVERSE``, flips motor **and** encoder pins, inverting the direction of the motor. Defaults to ``DIRECT``

        * ``DIRECT`` - Do not flip direction
        * ``REVERSE`` - Flip direction

    :param enc_dir: When set to ``REVERSE``, flips encoder pins **only**. Not necessary for LEGO motors, but useful for non-LEGO gearmotors when the encoder input and motor output increment in opposing directions. Defaults to ``DIRECT``

    .. code-block:: cpp

        EVNMotor motor1(1, EV3_MED);
        EVNMotor motor2(2, EV3_LARGE);
        EVNMotor motor3(3, NXT_LARGE, REVERSE);
        EVNMotor motor4(4, CUSTOM_MOTOR, DIRECT, REVERSE);

Functions
---------

.. function:: void begin()

    Initializes motor object. Call this function before calling the other EVNMotor functions (including settings functions).

    .. code-block:: cpp

        EVNMotor motor(1, EV3_MED);

        void setup1()   //call on setup1(), not setup()!
        {
            motor.begin();
        }

.. note::
    EVNMotor **should** be initialized on the 2nd core using ``void setup1()``.
    However, you can still call all movement and settings functions in ``void loop()`` like a normal program.

.. warning::
    This function only completes when EVNAlpha has been initialized using its ``begin()`` function on the 1st core (in ``void setup()``).
    If EVNMotor and EVNAlpha must run on the same core for your program(not recommended for stability!), make sure EVNAlpha is initialized first.

    Compared to braking with `stop()`, motor comes to a stop more slowly.

    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        motor.coast();

.. function:: void hold()

    Hold the motor in its current position. Restricts the motor shaft from moving.

    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        motor.hold();

Control Settings
""""""""""""""""

To view the default PD and accel/decel values, look at ``src\evn_motor_defs.h`` in the Github repository.

.. function:: void setKp(float kp)

    Sets proportional gain values for the PD controller (controls rotational/angular velocity of motor shaft).

    The error for the controller is the difference between the robot's target amount of rotations (which increases over time) and the angle the robot has currently rotated by.

    :param kp: Proportional gain

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setKp(0.2);

.. function:: void setKd(float kd)

    Sets derivative gain values for the PD controller (controls rotational/angular velocity of motor shaft).

    The error for the controller is the difference between the robot's target amount of rotations (which increases over time) and the angle the robot has currently rotated by.

    :param kd: Derivative gain

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setKd(0.00600);

.. function:: void setAccel(float accel_dps_per_s)

    Set acceleration value of motor (in deg/s^2). This value can be adjusted to avoid wheel slippage caused by high accelerations.

    :param accel_dps_per_s: Acceleration in DPS per second

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setAccel(500);

.. function:: void setDecel(float decel_dps_per_s)

    Set deceleration value of motor (in deg/s^2). This value can be adjusted to avoid wheel slippage caused by high accelerations.

    :param accel_dps_per_s: Deceleration in DPS per second

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setDecel(500);

.. function:: void setPWMMapping(float mag, float exp)

    Set PWM mapping for motor. Instead of mapping the PD controller output to a linear PWM value, 
    the output is mapped non-linearly for better performance, using the following formula:
    `PWM Output = mag * e to the power of (exp * output)`

    For Mindstorms motors, this is already provided in the motor profiles, but this can be used to set mappings for custom motors.

    :param mag: Mangitude component (negative values will set motor to map linearly)
    :param exp: Exponent component (negative values will set motor to map linearly)

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setPWMMapping(0.212, 0.00403);

.. note::
    We're also working on sharing how to generate such mappings for your custom motors!

.. function:: void setMaxRPM(float unloaded_max_rpm, float loaded_max_rpm = -1)

    Set motor's max RPM at full battery charge when motor shaft is unloaded (``unloaded_max_rpm``).
    Using this value, EVN Alpha will automatically scale the motor's maximum RPM based on the battery charge level on startup.
    
    This is particularly useful for drivebase movements, where accurate turning might depend on motors being able to achieve their maximum speeds.
    As the battery discharges, the maximum speed of the motor gradually decreases.

    For greater accuracy, you can also specify max RPM for the motor under load (``loaded_max_rpm``). 
    However, this may only be useful if the motor is driving a constant load (e.g. a robot driving only on flat terrain).

    :param unloaded_max_rpm: Maximum unloaded RPM of motor
    :param loaded_max_rpm: Maximum loaded RPM of motor (defaults to -1, negative values mean only ``unloaded_max_rpm`` will be used)

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setMaxRPM(140, 100);

.. function:: void setPPR(float ppr)

    Set pulses per revolution of motor shaft. For all LEGO EV3/NXT motors, PPR is 360 so it requires no adjustment.

    Some motor manufacturers specify the motor's CPR (counts per revolution), which is 4 times of a motor's PPR when using quadrature encoders.

    :param ppr: Pulses per revolution of motor

    .. code-block:: cpp

        motor.setPPR(823);

.. function:: void setDebug(bool enable)

    Used to toggle debug mode, where motor will print the error used for PD control over ``Serial``. Can be used to observe or tune PD controller behaviour.

    :param enable: Whether to enable debug mode

How Our Motor Control Works
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a little technical, but feel free to skip it!

For move functions where the motor rotates by a fixed amount, what we actually do is set a **target position** for the motor to move to. 
This target position starts out as the motor's **current position**, but **increments over time** until it reaches the **end position** given by the user.

It increments at the speed given by the user, so if the user wants to run their motor at 30DPS, the position signal increases at a rate of 30 degrees per second.

Now that we have the position signal, we need a way to command our motor to follow this position signal closely (thus moving at the desired speed to the desired endpoint).
We use a **Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller** to do so. It receives the **error** between our motor's current position and the target position signal, and **outputs the required duty cycle** we need to run our motor at.

However, this approach usually requires one to **tune** the PD controller's settings to ensure the motor follows the position signal closely, without being too slow or oscillating. 
Tuning motor PIDs is a bit tricky (you won't have to do it for LEGO motors), but we will be creating a guide for it soon!
