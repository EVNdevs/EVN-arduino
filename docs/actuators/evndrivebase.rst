``EVNDrivebase``
================

Building upon the functionality provided by EVNMotor, EVNDrivebase provides functions useful for controlling differential drive robots.

.. note:: EVNDrivebase consumes some of the RP2040's spinlock peripherals. See this `page`_ for more info.

Constructor
-----------

.. class:: EVNDrivebase(float wheel_dia, float axle_track, EVNMotor* motor_left, EVNMotor* motor_right);

    :param wheel_dia: Diameter of each wheel (in mm)
    :param axle_track: Distance between midpoint of both wheels (in mm)
    :param motor_left: Pointer to ``EVNMotor`` object for left motor
    :param motor_right: Pointer to ``EVNMotor`` object for right motor

    .. code-block:: cpp

        EVNMotor left_motor(1, EV3_MED);
        EVNMotor right_motor(2, EV3_MED, REVERSE);

        //wheel diameter - 62.4mm, axle track - 178mm
        EVNDrivebase db(62.4, 178, &left_motor, &right_motor);

.. note::

    For those new to C++, pointers can be quite confusing! Think of ``&`` as a means for you to provide a link to an object. 
    Here, we pass a link to ``EVNMotor`` objects to our ``EVNDrivebase`` object, so that it can control the ``EVNMotor`` objects just like the user can.

Functions
---------

.. function:: void begin();

    Initializes drivebase object. Call this function after calling ``begin()`` on the EVNMotor objects (which still need to be called!), but before calling any other ``EVNDrivebase`` functions (including settings functions).

    .. code-block:: cpp

        EVNMotor left_motor(1, EV3_MED);
        EVNMotor right_motor(2, EV3_MED, REVERSE);
        EVNDrivebase db(62.4, 178, &left_motor, &right_motor);

        void setup1()
        {
            left_motor.begin();
            right_motor.begin();
            db.begin();
        }

.. note::
    This command should be run on the 2nd core using ``void setup1()``. 
    However, you can still call the movement functions in ``void loop()`` like a normal program.

Move Forever
""""""""""""

.. function::   void drive(float speed, float turn_rate);
                void driveTurnRate(float speed, float turn_rate);

    Runs drivebase at the given speed and turn rate until a new command is called

    :param speed: Velocity of drivebase (in mm/s)
    :param turn_rate: Turning rate of drivebase (in deg/s)

    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        //drive at a velocity of 50mm/s and turning rate of 5deg/s
        db.drive(50, 5);

.. function:: void driveRadius(float speed, float radius);

    Runs drivebase at the given speed and radius of turning until a new command is called

    :param speed: Velocity of drivebase (in mm/s)
    :param radius: Turning radius of drivebase (in mm)

    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        //drive at a velocity of 50mm/s and move in an arc of radius 50mm
        db.driveRadius(50, 50);

.. function:: void drivePct(float speed_outer_pct, float turn_rate_pct)
    
    This function simulates a differential drive function where the outer wheel speed is given as a percentage, 
    along with a "turning rate" percentage input to define the turning behaviour as described below:

    0% "turning rate": Both wheels run at speed_outer_pct, same direction
    50% "turning rate": One wheel stationary, other wheel runs at speed_outer_pct (one-wheel turn)
    100% "turning rate": Both wheels run at speed_outer_pct, but in opposite directions

    Positive turning rate values turn anti-clockwise, negative values turn clockwise.

    Since the inputs range from -100 to 100 (unlike driveRadius, where radius ranges to infinity), it can be easier to use this function for PID control.

    :param speed_outer_pct: Speed for outer (faster) wheel in % (number from -100 to 100)
    :param turn_rate_pct: Turning rate of drivebase in % (number from -100 to 100)

    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        //drive forwards at 100% speed
        db.drivePct(100, 0);
        //drive forwards at 50% speed
        db.drivePct(50, 0);
        //drive backwards at 100% speed
        db.drivePct(-100, 0);
        //one-wheel clockwise turn at full speed
        db.drivePct(100, 50);
        //rotate clockwise on the spot at full speed
        db.drivePct(100, 100);

    Runs drivebase in a curve of specified radius until its heading has shifted by the given angle, then performs given stop action.

Stopping
""""""""

.. function::   void stop()

    Brakes both drivebase motors (slow decay). 

    .. code-block:: cpp
        
        db.stop();

.. function:: void coast()
    
    Coasts both drivebase motors to a stop (fast decay). 
    Compared to braking with `stop()`, the drivebase comes to a stop more slowly.
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.coast();

.. function:: void hold()
    
    Hold drivebase motors in their current positions. Restricts the motor shafts from moving.

    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.hold();

Control Settings
""""""""""""""""

To view the default accel/decel values, look at ``src\evn_motor_defs.h`` in the Github repository.

The PD values for the speed and turn rate controllers are obtained from the motor objects linked to drivebase.

If both motors are the same motor type, then the EVNMotor PD value for that motor type will be used by default.
Otherwise, the CUSTOM_MOTOR PD values are used.

.. function:: void setSpeedKp(float kp);

    Sets proportional gain values for the speed controller (controls average drivebase speed).

    The error for the controller is the difference between the robot's target distance travelled and the robot's current distance travelled (in motor degrees).

    :param kp: Proportional gain

    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.setSpeedKp(20);

.. function:: void setSpeedKd(float kd);

    Sets derivative gain values for the speed controller (controls average drivebase speed).

    The error for the controller is the difference between the robot's target distance travelled and the robot's current distance travelled (in motor degrees).

    :param kd: Derivative gain

    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.setSpeedKd(0.2);

.. function:: void setTurnRateKp(float kp);

    Sets proportional gain values for the turn rate controller (controls rate of turning of drivebase).

    The error for the controller is the difference between the robot's target angle and the robot's current angle (in motor degrees).

    This controller serves 2 purposes: to ensure the drivebase turns at the correct rate, and to stop either motor if the other is stalled, syncing their movement.

    :param kp: Proportional gain

    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.setTurnRateKp(20);

.. function:: void setTurnRateKd(float kd);

    The error for the controller is the difference between the robot's target angle and the robot's current angle (in motor degrees).

    This controller serves 2 purposes: to ensure the drivebase turns at the correct rate, and to stop either motor if the other is stalled, syncing their movement.

        db.setSpeedDecel(500);

.. function:: void setTurnRateAccel(float accel_deg_per_s_sq);

    Sets turn rate acceleration value for drivebase (in deg/s^2).

    :param accel_deg_per_s_sq: Acceleration in deg/s^2

    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.setTurnRateAccel(500);

.. function:: void setTurnRateDecel(float decel_deg_per_s_sq);

    Sets turn rate deceleration value for drivebase (in deg/s^2).

    .. code-block:: cpp
    
        db.setTurnRateDecel(500);

.. function:: void setDebug(uint8_t debug_type)

    Used to toggle debug mode, where drivebase will print the error for either speed or turn rate PD control over ``Serial``. Can be used to observe or tune PD controller behaviour.
